# weather-pred-finalyear-

#this is a temporary read me, will be changed before submission.

# the last we discussed we had temp,pressure,humidity as independant variable, the regression model then formed what only 50 % accurate and when divided into training and testing gave a negative test score.

#to improve the model i have added rainfall in millimemter also as an independent variable with the total precipitation of the day as the dependent variable, now the model seems to be 90+% accurate.(something i discovered by pure accident while i was trying to solve the issues)
# check the data table,the code(comments added) , and the final graph and if there is any doubt we can sit together.
